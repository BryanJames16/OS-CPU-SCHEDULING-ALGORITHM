# Operating System CPU Scheduling Algorithms
An implementation of Operating System CPU Scheduling Algorithms written in Java. All codes have been tested prior, and only `Shortest Remaining Time First` or `SRTF` algorithm has been tested to be having some bugs.

**Algorithms Included:**
- First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Deadline
- Priority
- P-Prio
- Round Robin
- Shortest Remaining Time First
- Multi-Level Queue (MLQ)
